# DAY 6

## Questions :  
• Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.  
• Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.  
• Given two integer arrays preorder and inorder where preorder is the preorder traversal of a binary tree and inorder is the inorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree.  
• Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).  
• You are given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) rooted at  node 0 consisting of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1. The tree is represented by a 0-indexed array parent of size n, where parent[i] is the parent of node i. Since node 0 is the root, parent[0] == -1. You are also given a string s of length n, where s[i] is the character assigned to node i. Return the length of the longest path in the tree such that no pair of adjacent nodes on the 
path have the same character assigned to them.
